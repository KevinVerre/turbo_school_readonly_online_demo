                <h1>Introduction to Algebra and Its History</h1><p>Algebra is a branch of mathematics concerned with the manipulation and solving of equations. The word “algebra” comes from the Arabic word “al-jabr,” meaning reunion of broken parts. The concept of Algebra dates back to ancient Egypt and Babylon, but the Arabic mathematician Muhammad Al-Khwarizmi is credited with the development of modern Algebra in the 9th century.</p><h2>Basic Algebraic Concepts</h2><p>In Algebra, we use letters to represent unknown values in equations. These letters are called variables. We use operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to manipulate the variables in equations to solve for their values.</p><h3>Equations and Expressions</h3><p>An equation is a mathematical statement involving two expressions that are equal. For example, 4x + 2 = 18 is an equation. An expression is a mathematical phrase that can contain variables, constants, and mathematical operations, but it does not have an equal sign. For example, 3x + 5 is an expression.</p><h4>Order of Operations</h4><p>When solving equations, we follow the order of operations. The acronym PEMDAS is used to remember the order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).</p><h2>Uses of Algebra</h2><p>Algebra has many uses in everyday life and in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science. It is used to solve practical problems, make predictions, and develop models. For example, Algebra is used in budgeting, calculating interest rates, and optimizing resources.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In conclusion, Algebra is a powerful mathematical tool that has been used for centuries to solve problems and make predictions. It has applications in various fields and continues to play an important role in modern mathematics and science.</p>

            <div style="width: 90%">
                <h1>Graphing Linear Equations</h1><p>Linear equations have the general form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Graphing linear equations helps us visualize how changes to the variables affect the relationship between them.</p><h2>Plotting Points</h2><p>The most basic way to graph a linear equation is to plot points. We can pick any x and solve for y to get a point on the line. Then we can plot that point and connect the dots to create the line. For example, let's graph the equation y = 2x + 1. We can choose some values of x:</p><ul>
<li>x = 0</li>
<li>x = 1</li>
<li>x = -1</li>
</ul><p>Then we can solve for y:</p><ul>
<li>y = 2(0) + 1 = 1, so the point (0,1) is on the line.</li>
<li>y = 2(1) + 1 = 3, so the point (1,3) is on the line.</li>
<li>y = 2(-1) + 1 = -1, so the point (-1,-1) is on the line.</li>
</ul><p>Now we can plot those points and connect them to get the line:</p><img alt="Graph of y = 2x + 1" src="https://i.imgur.com/lL5OzFW.png"/><h2>Slope and y-Intercept</h2><p>Another way to graph a linear equation is to use the slope and y-intercept. The slope tells us how steep the line is, and the y-intercept tells us where the line crosses the y-axis. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. To graph this equation, we can start at the y-intercept and move up or down depending on the slope. For example, let's graph the equation y = -2x + 3:</p><ul>
<li>The y-intercept is 3, so the point (0,3) is on the line.</li>
<li>The slope is -2, which means we move down 2 (since it's negative) and over 1. This gives us another point: (1,1).</li>
<li>We can continue this pattern to get more points and plot them: (-1,5), (2,-1), etc.</li>
</ul><p>Now we can connect those points to get the line:</p><img alt="Graph of y = -2x + 3" src="https://i.imgur.com/F0ibEum.png"/><h2>Parallel and Perpendicular Lines</h2><p>When graphing two linear equations, we can also determine if they are parallel or perpendicular. Two lines are parallel if their slopes are equal, and they are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals (i.e. if one slope is m, the other slope is -1/m).</p><p>For example, let's graph the equations y = 2x + 1 and y = 2x - 3:</p><ul>
<li>The slope of both lines is 2, so they are parallel.</li>
<li>Let's graph y = 2x + 1 and y = -1/2x - 1:</li>
<ul>
<li>The first line has a slope of 2, so we move up 2 and over 1 to get another point: (1,3).</li>
<li>The second line has a slope of -1/2, so we move down 1 and over 2 to get another point: (2,-1).</li>
<li>We can plot these points and connect them to get the lines:</li>
</ul>
</ul><img alt="Graph of y = 2x + 1 and y = -1/2x - 1" src="https://i.imgur.com/fytnMcD.png"/>

                <h1>Factoring</h1><p>Factoring is the process of finding the factors of a given polynomial equation. It is an important concept in Algebra, which is useful in solving complex equations and in simplifying expressions.</p><h2>Types of Factoring</h2><p>There are three types of factoring:</p><ol>
<li><b>GCF Factoring:</b> Finding the greatest common factor of all the terms of the polynomial and factoring it out.</li>
<li><b>Trinomial Factoring:</b> Factoring a polynomial expression of three terms.</li>
<li><b>Grouping Factoring:</b> Factoring a polynomial expression into groups and factoring out the GCF of each group.</li>
</ol><h2>GCF Factoring</h2><p>GCF (Greatest Common Factor) is the largest factor that divides two or more terms. The steps to solve GCF factoring are:</p><ol>
<li>Find the GCF of all the terms in the polynomial.</li>
<li>Write the terms as products of the GCF and the remaining factors.</li>
<li>Combine the factors and simplify the expression.</li>
</ol><p>Example: Factor 12x<sup>2</sup>y + 8xy<sup>2</sup></p><ol>
<li>The GCF of 12x<sup>2</sup>y and 8xy<sup>2</sup> is 4xy.</li>
<li>Write the terms as products of the GCF and the remaining factors: 4xy(3x + 2y).</li>
<li>Combine the factors: 4xy(3x + 2y) is the factored form of the polynomial.</li>
</ol><h2>Trinomial Factoring</h2><p>The trinomial expression is in the form of ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants. The steps to solve trinomial factoring are:</p><ol>
<li>Find the factors of the first term (ax<sup>2</sup>) and the last term (c).</li>
<li>Identify which factor pairs add up to the coefficient of the middle term (bx).</li>
<li>Write the original trinomial as the product of two binomials, using the factor pairs identified in step 2.</li>
</ol><p>Example: Factor 2x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 3</p><ol>
<li>The factors of 2x<sup>2</sup> are 2x and x. The factors of 3 are 1 and 3.</li>
<li>The possible factor pairs that add up to 5x are (2x, 3) and (x, 3).</li>
<li>The factored form of the polynomial is (2x + 3)(x + 1).</li>
</ol><h2>Grouping Factoring</h2><p>Grouping Factoring is used when the polynomial has four or more terms. The steps to solve grouping factoring are:</p><ol>
<li>Group the polynomial into two pairs of terms.</li>
<li>Factor out the GCF of each pair.</li>
<li>Identify a common binomial factor in each pair and factor it out.</li>
<li>Write the factored form of the polynomial as a product of the two binomials in the form (a + b)(c + d).</li>
</ol><p>Example: Factor 2x<sup>3</sup> + 4x<sup>2</sup> - 3x - 6</p><ol>
<li>Group the polynomial into two pairs of terms: (2x<sup>3</sup> + 4x<sup>2</sup>) and (-3x - 6)</li>.
		<li>Factor out the GCF of each pair: 2x<sup>2</sup>(x + 2) and -3(x + 2)</li>.
		<li>Identify a common binomial factor in each pair and factor it out: (x + 2)</li>.
		<li>Write the factored form of the polynomial as a product of the two binomials in the form (a + b)(c + d): (2x<sup>2</sup> - 3)(x + 2).</li>
